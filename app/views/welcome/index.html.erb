<h1>Hi, I'm Jack Bryant</h1>

     <article>

          <p> I’m a junior full-stack software developer based in London. </p>
          <p> I’ve recently finished <a href="http://www.makersacademy.com/"> Makers Academy</a>, a 3 month course in web development that covered Ruby on Rails, TDD, BDD, Javascript/Coffeescript, JQuery, SQL, HTML5, CSS3. </p>
          <p> I love working in small teams that are passionate about what they are doing. I also love music. </p>
          <p> While at Makers Academy, I worked on <a href="https://github.com/dwkns/fireworks"> Launch.it</a> an app that lets you design a firework show to an audio track then remotely trigger the show using a Raspberry Pi and a smartphone. </p>
          <p> I’m also a co-founder and DJ at <a href="http://mogadisco.wordpress.com/"> Mogadisco</a>, an African music event and blog. </p>
